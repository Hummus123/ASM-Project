# Assembler Honors Project, Digital Systems II
## Johannes Hundt - Dr. Patru
This is an assembler written in Python. It mainly utilizes regular expressions to parse input text and create
tokens. Once tokenized, it performs a variety of error checks to ensure proper code formatting, and turns it into
the corresponding binary. Jumps are fully implemented, no need to change the binary when it is created. It is also
functional for all ISA schemes which are possible as per your identification numbers required instructions. Included
are a handful of test ASM files, some of which are erroneous.
